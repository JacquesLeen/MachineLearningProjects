    "It is the basic block of the NN. They are creat in analogy with actual Neurons in our brain, we recreate those into a machine. But how?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron has got a body, dendrites and an axon.  Alone the neuron cant do much but a mln of them becomes very powerful. The dendrites are the receivers of the signal, and the axon passes the signals over to the next neuron through a synapse (which is actually a void space).\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML the neuron gets a signal from inputs (mre than one) and has sends an output signals. The input corresponds to the senses of a person that sends electrical impulses to the brain. The brain is \"just\" a black box in that sense. Inouts are independent variable for A SINGLE OBSERVATION and they have to be standardized or normalized.\n",
